TODO list:
1) Locks support.
2) RPM
3) Do multiple SPFS mounts via command. This (with semaphore synchronisation
via shm) will allow to order cgroup freezing among multiple NFS remounters.
4) Do something with "--exit-with-spfs" option, when there are a lot of them.
5) Mount tmpfs on spfs working directory. Ans umount and unlink this directory on exit.
